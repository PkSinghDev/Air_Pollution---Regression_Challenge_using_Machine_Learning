# Air_Pollution---Regression_Challenge_using_Machine_Learning
### Predicting Air Pollution Levels using Regression models


## Problem Statement: -
It is winter time in Delhi. Aki wants to go outside but is afraid of the Air Quality news of Delhi published yesterday. Aki is a Machine Learning expert. So he decided to help local residents by collecting air samples from various locations at Delhi. He took these samples to his lab and extracted five features which can be used to predict Air Quality index. Aki's job is to use the extracted features and predict the Air Quality index so that he can advise his local residents whether it is safe to move out or not.

### Train Data: -
The train data consists of five feature columns and one target column. All the feature columns are numeric and target value is also numeric.

### Test Data: -
The test data consists of all the columns as train data except for the target column which Aki has to predict using the model trained on the train data available.
